            <strong>Dear LC.</strong>
            <p>I made this for you hoping that you would like it. It took me over 6 hours to code and edit
                Its definetyly a step up from the first html site i made you lol. This is our 6th Valentines Day
                and our love still feels as though we just met. These last 2 years have been difficult for you and 
                I promise to be here to support you and get through it. I see so much in you that you dont in yourself
                You are nothing short of a boss, push your limits and reach your full potential. I love you and thank you for 
                all the support and love that youve always given me, pushing me when i feel down and when the task wasnt
                easy. I look forward to more with you and till next year babe . xoxo (cant draw a heart lol)
            </p>

      if (letter.style.display === 'none') {
        letter.style.display = 'block'; // Show letter instead of changing opacity
      } else {
